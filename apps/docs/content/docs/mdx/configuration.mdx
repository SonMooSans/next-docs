## Plugin Options

Fumadocs MDX offers webpack plugins and a Fumadocs [Source API](/docs/headless/source-api) adapter to integrate with Fumadocs.
You can configure Fumadocs MDX by passing options to `createMDX` in `next.config.mjs`.

```ts
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // options
});
```

### Root Content Directory

Fumadocs MDX only scans for a specific folder to produce the `.map` file, it's called the root content directory.

By default, it points to `./content` in the root directory. You can customise it with the `rootContentDir` option.

### Map File Path

Customise the file path of `.map` file with the `rootMapPath` option.

### Include

Include or filter files to the `.map` file, it uses micromatch under the hood which supports Regex.

```ts
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  include: ['./**/*.{md,mdx,json}'],
});
```

### Current Working Directory

Customise the current working directory with the `cwd` option, default to `process.cwd()`.

## MDX Options

Fumadocs MDX uses the [MDX Compiler](https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx) to compile MDX files into JavaScript files.
You can configure the compiler with the `mdxOptions` option.

### Remark Plugins

These plugins are applied by default:

- [Remark Image](/docs/headless/mdx/remark-image) - Handle images
- [Remark Heading](/docs/headless/mdx/toc) - Extract table of contents
- [Remark Structure](/docs/headless/mdx/structure) - Generate search indexes
- Custom Remark Plugin - Exports the output generated by remark plugins above

You can add other remark plugins with:

```ts
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';
import { myPlugin } from './remark-plugin';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [myPlugin],
  },
});
```

You can also pass a function to control the order of remark plugins.

```ts
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';
import { myPlugin } from './remark-plugin';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: (v) => [myPlugin, ...v],
  },
});
```

### Rehype Plugins

These plugins are applied by default:

- [Rehype Code](/docs/headless/mdx/rehype-code) - Syntax highlighting

Same as remark plugins, you can pass an array or a function to add other rehype plugins.

```ts
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';
import { myPlugin } from './rehype-plugin';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    rehypePlugins: (v) => [myPlugin, ...v],
  },
});
```

### Rehype Code

Customise the options for Rehype Code and [Shiki](https://shiki.style).

```ts
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    rehypeCode: { ... }
  },
});
```

### Export Properties from `vfile.data`

Some remark plugins store their output in `vfile.data` (an compile-time memory) which cannot be accessed from your code.
Fumadocs MDX applies a remark plugin that turns `vfile.data` properties into exports, so that you can access these properties when importing the MDX file.

You can define additional properties to be exported.

```js
const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    valueToExport: ['dataName'],
  },
});
```

By default, it includes:

- `toc` for the Remark Heading plugin
- `structuredData` for the Remark Structure Plugin
- `frontmatter` for the frontmatter of MDX (using `gray-matter`)

## Search Index Options

Pass the `buildSearchIndex` option to configure search index generation.

See [Search Index Generation](/docs/mdx/search-index) to learn more.
