## Introduction

Fumadocs <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(Foo-ma docs)</span> is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast and flexible.
It composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router, allowing a high flexibility with code.

Fumadocs has different parts:

<Card icon={<CpuIcon className="text-purple-300" />} title='Fumadocs Core'>

Handles most of the logic, including document search, content source adapters, and Markdown extensions.

<Card icon={<PanelsTopLeft className="text-blue-300" />} title='Fumadocs UI'>

The default theme of Fumadocs, it offers a beautiful look for documentation sites and interactive components.

</Card>

<Card icon={<Database />} title='Content Source'>

The input/source of your content, it can be a CMS, or local data layers like [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev) and [Fumadocs MDX](/docs/mdx), the official content source.

<Card icon={<Terminal />} title='Fumadocs CLI'>

A command line tool to install UI components similar to Shadcn UI and automate things.

### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Fumadocs supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown) out-of-the-box.

Some basic knowledge of Next.js App Router would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`, it requires Node.js 18+.

> Node.js 23.1.x might have problems with Next.js production build.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create fumadocs-app
```

</Tabs>

It will initialize a new fumadocs app.
Now you can start hacking!

### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```package-install
npm run dev
```

## Explore

In the project, you can see:

- `lib/source.ts`: Where you organize code for content source adapter, we use [`loader()`](/docs/headless/source-api) to parse and interact with your content source.
- `app/layout.config.tsx`: Shared options for layouts, this is optional but preferred to keep.
- `app/(home)`: The route group for your landing page and other pages.
- `app/docs`: The documentation layout and pages.
- `app/api/search/route.ts`: The Route Handler for search.

### Customise Content

Content source handles all your content, including validation and type definitions for data like frontmatter.

For **Fumadocs MDX**, you can read the [Introduction](/docs/mdx) to learn how it handles your content,
and customise different options like frontmatter schema. A `source.config.ts` config file has been included.

For custom sources that is not supported by default (like Sanity), you can [build a custom content source](/docs/headless/custom-source).

### Customise Sidebar

Navigation elements like sidebar take a [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree) to render navigation links, it's a tree that describes all available pages and folders.

By default, the sidebar items (formally page tree) are generated from your file structure.
You can learn how to customise the page tree from:

### Writing Content

Despite from supported syntax of MDX, Fumadocs has some additional features for authoring content too.

## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='customise' title='How to Customise UI?'>

Fumadocs UI offers Themes, Layouts and Components.

The design system is built with Tailwind CSS, see [Themes](/docs/ui/theme).

Components are pre-built elements to enhance your documentation,
they are customisable with exposed props like `style` and `className`.

Layouts are essential elements of docs, providing navigation and basic functionality.
We provided many options to customise them, see [Layouts](/docs/ui/layouts).

Fumadocs CLI offers a way to install Fumadocs components to your project, allowing you to fully customise them with code.

```package-install
@fumadocs/cli --save-dev
```

```bash
pnpm fumadocs add
```

This is inspired and very similar to Shadcn UI.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='fix-monorepo-styling' title="How to fix stylings not being applied in Monorepo?">

Sometimes, `fumadocs-ui` is not installed in the workspace of your Tailwind CSS configuration file. (e.g. a monorepo setup).

You have to ensure the `fumadocs-ui` package is scanned by Tailwind CSS, and give a correct relative path to `@source`.

For example, add `../../` to point to the `node_modules` folder in root workspace.

        ```css
        @import 'tailwindcss';
        @import 'fumadocs-ui/css/neutral.css';
        @import 'fumadocs-ui/css/preset.css';

        /* [!code --] */
        @source '../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js';
        /* [!code ++] */
        @source '../../../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js';
        ```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='change-base-url' title="How to change the base route of /docs?">

You can change the base route of docs (e.g. from `/docs/page` to `/info/page`).
Since Fumadocs uses Next.js App Router, you can simply rename the route:

<Files>
  <Folder name="app/docs" defaultOpen className="opacity-50" disabled>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="app/info" defaultOpen>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

And tell Fumadocs to use the new route in `source.ts`:

```ts title="source.ts"
import { createMDXSource } from 'fumadocs-mdx';
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';
import { docs, meta } from '@/.source';

export const source = loader({
  baseUrl: '/info',
  source: createMDXSource(docs, meta),
});
```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='dynamic-route' title="It uses Dynamic Route, will it be poor in performance?">

Next.js turns dynamic route into static routes when `generateStaticParams` is configured.
Hence, it is as fast as static pages.

You can enable Static Exports on Next.js to get a static build output. (Notice that Route Handler doesn't work with static export, you have to configure static search)

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='custom-layout-docs-page' title='How to create a page in /docs without docs layout?'>

Same as managing layouts in Next.js App Router, remove the original MDX file from content directory (`/content/docs`).
This ensures duplicated pages will not cause errors.

Now, You can add the page to another route group, which isn't a descendant of docs layout.

For example, under your `app` folder:

<Files>
  <File name="(home)/docs/page.tsx" />
  <Folder name="docs">
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
    <File name="[[...slug]]/page.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

will replace the `/docs` page with your `page.tsx`.

    </Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Why Fumadocs?

Fumadocs is designed with flexibility in mind.

You can use `fumadocs-core` as a headless UI library and bring your own styles.
Fumadocs MDX is also a useful library to handle MDX content in Next.js. It also includes:

- Many built-in components.
- Typescript Twoslash, OpenAPI, and Math (KaTeX) integrations.
- Fast and optimized by default, natively built on App Router.
- Tight integration with Next.js, you can add it to an existing Next.js project easily.

Feel free to open the demo in CodeSandbox, or read [Comparisons](/docs/ui/comparisons) if you're interested.

### Documentation

Fumadocs focuses on **authoring experience**, it provides a beautiful theme and many docs automation tools.

It helps you to iterate your codebase faster while never leaving your docs behind.
You can take this site as an example of docs site built with Fumadocs.

### Blog sites

Since Next.js is already a powerful framework, most features can be implemented with **just Next.js**.

Fumadocs provides additional tooling for Next.js, including syntax highlighting, document search, and a default theme (Fumadocs UI).
It helps you to avoid reinventing the wheels.
