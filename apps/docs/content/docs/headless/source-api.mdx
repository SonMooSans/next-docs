description: Turn a content source into an unified interface

## Usage

Source API is a helper to load file-system based content sources, it offers an unified interface to integrate different content sources with Fumadocs.

It handles some important jobs:

- Build page trees from file-system information
- Generate Urls and slugs based on file path
- Output useful utilities to search or walk over files

It doesn't rely on the real file system (zero `node:fs` usage), a virtual storage is also allowed.

You can use it with built-in content sources like Fumadocs MDX.

```ts
import { map } from '@/.map';
import { createMDXSource } from 'fumadocs-mdx';
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

export const docs = loader({
  source: createMDXSource(map),
});
```

> The output page tree strictly follows [Page Conventions](/docs/headless/page-conventions).

### Root Directory

All files outside of the root directory will be ignored.

```ts
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

loader({
  rootDir: 'docs',
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Relative paths, like `./` and `../` are not supported.
</Callout>

### Base URL

As the `loader` function also generate an URL for each page, you can override the default base URL.

```ts
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

loader({
  baseUrl: '/docs',
});
```

### Icons

Load the [icon](/docs/headless/page-conventions#icons) property specified by pages and meta files.

```ts
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';
import { icons } from 'lucide-react';
import { createElement } from 'react';

export const utils = loader({
  icon(icon) {
    if (!icon) {
      // You may set a default icon
      return;
    }

    if (icon in icons) return createElement(icons[icon as keyof typeof icons]);
  },
});
```

## Deep Dive

As mentioned, Source API doesn't rely on real file systems.
During the process, your input source files will be parsed and form a virtual storage to avoid inconsistent behaviour between different OS.

### Transformer

To perform virtual file-system operations before processing, you can add a transformer.

```ts
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

loader({
  transformers: [
    ({ storage }) => {
      storage.makeDir();
    },
  ],
});
```

### Attach Custom Properties

The `pageTree` option allows you to customise how the page tree builder processes different nodes.

You can attach custom properties to page tree nodes, like customising the display name of pages and folders.

```ts
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

loader({
  pageTree: {
    attachFolderIds: true, // add `folder.id` property
    attachFolder: (node) => ({ ... }), // change folder nodes
  }
});
```

JSX nodes are also allowed.

```tsx
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

export const docs = loader({
  pageTree: {
    attachFile(node) {
      node.name = <>Some JSX Nodes here</>;
      return node;
    },
  },
});
```

### Custom Source

To plug your own content source, create a `Source` object.

It includes a `files` property which is an array of virtual files.
Each virtual file must contain its file path and corresponding data.
Yo can check type definitions for more info.

Since Source API doesn't rely on file system, file paths cannot be absolute or relative (for example, `./file.mdx` and `D://content/file.mdx` are not allowed).
Instead, pass the file paths like `file.mdx` and`content/file.mdx`.

```ts
import { Source } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

export function createMySource(): Source<{
  metaData: { title: string; pages: string[] }; // Your custom type
  pageData: { title: string; description: string }; // Your custom type
}> {
  return {
    files: [],
  };
}
```
