description: Learn how to use a GitHub repository with Fumadocs
---

Fumadocs's GitHub integration allows you to use a
GitHub repository as a source for your documentation.

This means that, in production, your documentation will be automatically updated
whenever you make changes to the documentation located in your GitHub repository.

<Callout title="Note">
  Internally, we use a cache that allows us to incrementally update the
  documentation in real-time, avoiding reloading the entire documentation every
  time a change is made.
</Callout>

## Setup

```package-install
@fumadocs/mdx-remote
```
