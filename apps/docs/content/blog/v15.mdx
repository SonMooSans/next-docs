## Overview

The purpose of v15 is mainly to support Tailwind CSS v4.
Tailwind CSS v4 is a complete redesign of its API and internals, to fully adhere the new CSS-first config style, a breaking change is required.

Fumadocs v15 has no other significant changes than migrating the config to Tailwind CSS v4.

## Breaking Changes

Before making the switch, upgrade your site to Tailwind CSS v4 following their [upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide).
You can remove the unused `tailwind.config.js` file and fully rely on the new CSS-first config.

Add `@import` to the presets exported by Fumadocs UI, and include `fumadocs-ui` package into source.

```css title="Tailwind CSS"
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import 'fumadocs-ui/css/neutral.css';
@import 'fumadocs-ui/css/preset.css';

/* relative to the CSS file, make sure it's correct for your app */
@source '../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js';
```

Since v15, you will no longer pass options in JavaScript to customise plugins.
Instead, you can use the new alternatives in Tailwind CSS v4.

### `addGlobalColors: true`

Forward the colors again:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: var(--color-fd-primary);
  /* same for other colors */
}
```

### CSS Variables

Fumadocs no longer use `--fd-<color>` like `--fd-primary: 0 0% 0%` for colors, it directly defines and uses colors in `@theme`.
Instead of the previous format, it uses `hsl()`:

```css
@theme {
  --color-fd-primary: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Steps

Previous Tailwind CSS utilities like `steps` & `steps` are renamed to `fd-steps` and `fd-step` to avoid conflicts.

### Typography

Typography utilities including `prose`, `prose-*` modifiers will continue to work. Please report problems if they are no longer working or have unexpected change in behaviours.
