You can create a localized page for specific language by adding `.{locale}` to your file name, like `page.fr.md` or `page.cn.md`.
Pages can't be language-specific, you must create a page for the default locale.

This works for meta files too, you can add `.{locale}` to the file name like `meta.cn.json`.

> If it's the default language, just leave it empty like `get-started.mdx`. Do
> not add locale code to file name.

### Example

Assume your default language is `en`.

| Name              |                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| file.mdx          | Correct                                   |
| file.cn.mdx       | Correct                                   |
| file.en.mdx       | Default locale doesn't need a locale code |
| components.cn.mdx | Pages can't be language-specific          |
