**Remove GitHub remote integration**

**why:** It should be equivalent to `next-mdx-remote` but include extra functionalities by Fumadocs, like built-in MDX plugins, table of contents and frontmatter parsing.

**migrate:** Implement your own content source, or see our Sanity/BaseHub examples for CMS usages.
